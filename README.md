# baby-hacks
Stuff that I learned while having two babies. As with everything, this was my experience and YMMV.

## My overall baby advice can be summed up as follows:

1. Do what feels right for you, don't let societal pressure make you do things that you hate or make you miserable or doesn't feel like it works for you and your kid.
2. Whatever ideas you have before having a baby about the "right" or "wrong" way to parent will fly out the window! You will very quickly learn that you do whatever it takes to survive, and that's okay!
3. Sleep is the most important thing for EVERYONE. The vast majority of my advice will be sleep-related.
4. Seriously, sleep is the most important thing. You will be averaging 4 hours of sleep per day at first and you'll be a wreck if you don't quickly train your kid to sleep better.

## Stuff you need
### Furniture
- crib with option to raise the mattress higher when they are babies, and to convert to a toddler bed when they are older.
- rocking chair/glider with a tall back so you can rest your head and a footstool. Dutalier https://www.dutailier.com/ wooden frame ones look ugly but are hands down the best/most comfy! And if you buy one used, you can order new cushions from the company!
- changing table(s) if you have two floors you will want one per floor.
- (optional) Get or rent a Snoo if you can afford it, they didn't exist for my kids but everyone says they are amazing.
- Pack-n-play with a removable bassinet thingy so you don't have to reach super far down to get the baby out. You will need one for traveling anywhere for longer than a few hours
- (optional) co-sleeper that attaches to the side of your bed. I had an arm's reach https://www.armsreach.com/ that I bought used. It's a nice to have when you are nursing to just roll over and the baby is right there. 
- extra bed or futon in the baby's room so one parent can get a good nights sleep every now and then

### Other large baby items
- baby bouncer seat! This was one of our most-used items. We had an older version of this fisher price one https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Infant-to-Toddler-Rocker-Geo-Diamonds/dp/B014D4HHQI that turns into a toddler rocker and both kids loved it.
- 2 high chairs, a nicer indoor one and then the $20 ikea antilop https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/antilop-high-chair-with-tray-white-silver-color-s89228434/ which has removable legs for outdoors on the patio and/or travel. You don't need high chairs for the first 4ish months
- exersaucer/jumper (but you don't need one for a few months) once the kids outgrew the stationary bouncer we put them in the saucer.
- bucket style car seat, make sure to buy an extra base if you have multiple cars and a warm sleeping bag style cover for winter, I liked the jj cole ones https://www.amazon.com/JJ-Cole-Weather-Resistant-Herringbone/dp/B00P1BDGEU
- snap and go stroller frame that works with the bucket https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Trend-Snap-N-Go-Universal-Stroller/dp/B000BMKEVC this is way easier to manage when the baby is a newborn, you just click the bucket out of the car and right into the stroller!
- a nicer walking/jogging stroller that will work when the kid is older. Get one that is a single-hand unfold, we had a city mini and LOVED it! https://www.babyjogger.com/city-mini.html
- some sort of carrier wrap. My kids never liked the carriers that much, but I know lots of "baby wearing" lovers! Try different kinds before you buy (or buy used) if you can.
- Bumbo seat for when they are learning to sit.
 


- boppy pillow with extra covers


## Stuff you don't need
- a motorized swing. They take up a ton of space, have a very limited timespan, and didn't work well for calming my kids, but ymmv.
- kid-specific bedroom furniture (unless you don't have space in their bedroom for both a changing table and a dresser, getting a dresser with removable changing top makes sense)

## Tips
- make the crib up with 2-3 layers of mattress cover + sheet so you don't have to remake the crib in the middle of the night from a blowout or leak.
