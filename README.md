# baby-hacks
Stuff that I learned while having two babies. As with everything, this was my experience and YMMV.

## My overall baby advice can be summed up as follows:

1. Do what feels right for you, don't let societal pressure make you do things that you hate or make you miserable or doesn't feel like it works for you and your kid.
2. Whatever ideas you have before having a baby about the "right" or "wrong" way to parent will fly out the window! You will very quickly learn that you do whatever it takes to survive, and that's okay!
3. Sleep is the most important thing for EVERYONE. The vast majority of my advice will be sleep-related.
4. Seriously, sleep is the most important thing. You will be averaging 4 hours of sleep per day at first and you'll be a wreck if you don't quickly train your kid to sleep better.

## Stuff you need
Get as many things used as you possibly can. Hopefully you have friends and family you can get hand-me-downs from, and there are usually baby consignment stores where you can buy and eventually sell everything baby related (including maternity and nursing clothes for mom!) for store credit. This stuff doesn't last long so it's better for the planet and your wallet to recycle! I still go to our local baby consignment store for clothes!

### Furniture
- crib with option to raise the mattress higher when they are babies (so you don't have to lean over as far to get the baby out lol), and can convert to a toddler bed when they are older.
- rocking chair/glider with a tall back so you can rest your head and a footstool. Dutalier https://www.dutailier.com/ wooden frame ones look ugly but are hands down the best/most comfy! And if you buy one used, you can order new cushions from the company!
- changing table(s) if you have two floors you will want one per floor.
- (optional) Get or rent a Snoo if you can afford it, they didn't exist for my kids but everyone says they are amazing.
- Pack-n-play with a removable bassinet thingy so you don't have to reach super far down to get the baby out. You will need one for traveling anywhere for longer than a few hours
- (optional) co-sleeper that attaches to the side of your bed. I had an arm's reach https://www.armsreach.com/ that I bought used. It's a nice to have when you are nursing to just roll over and the baby is right there. 
- extra bed or futon in the baby's room so one parent can get a good nights sleep every now and then

### Other large/medium baby items
- baby bouncer seat! This was one of our most-used items. We had an older version of this fisher price one https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Infant-to-Toddler-Rocker-Geo-Diamonds/dp/B014D4HHQI that turns into a toddler rocker and both kids loved it.
- 2 high chairs, a nicer indoor one and then the $20 ikea antilop https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/antilop-high-chair-with-tray-white-silver-color-s89228434/ which has removable legs for outdoors on the patio and/or travel. You don't need high chairs for the first 4ish months
- exersaucer/jumper (but you don't need one for a few months) once the kids outgrew the stationary bouncer we put them in the saucer.
- bucket style car seat, make sure to buy an extra base if you have multiple cars
- snap and go stroller frame that works with the bucket https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Trend-Snap-N-Go-Universal-Stroller/dp/B000BMKEVC this is way easier to manage when the baby is a newborn, you just click the bucket out of the car and right into the stroller!
- a nicer walking/jogging stroller that will work when the kid is older. Get one that is a single-hand unfold, we had a city mini and LOVED it! https://www.babyjogger.com/city-mini.html
- an activity gym/play mat with a curved pillow to help prop them up for tummy time - something like this https://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-Silver-Lining-Activity/dp/B01G1JQXMW
- some sort of carrier wrap. My kids never liked the carriers that much, but I know lots of "baby wearing" lovers! Try different kinds before you buy (or buy used) if you can.
- Bumbo seat for when they are learning to sit.
- diaper trash can because that shit smells and a normal trash can does not handle it!

### VERY IMPORTANT SLEEP RELATED THINGS
- a marpac dohm (or I guess they rebranded to "yogasleep") white noise machine https://yogasleep.com/products/dohmclassic they are 100% mechanical and last forever. I recently opened one that wasn't working and removed all the dust and squirted WD40 and it works great again! Seriously this is the best!
- the 90 Minute Sleep Solution book. This book is magic and will save your sanity (more on this later)
- the happiest baby on the block (this is the snoo people)
- a few swaddle wraps - I liked the muslin ones. We swaddled the shit out of our kids
- Halo sleep sacks (a few of each size)  https://www.halosleep.com/shop/sleepsack-swaddle (note these might not be necessary with the snoo? I'm not sure)

### Clothing & Accessories
- onesies, lots of onesies, there are a few different styles you will need. Seriously babies live in onesies. 
-- the long-sleeve kind with built-in foldover mittens at the end of the arms
-- feetie onesies with the zipper (snaps are a pain in the butt)
-- my faves for sleep were the gown-style onesies so you can just pull it up to change a diaper and not deal with snaps or zippers or taking legs out in the middle of the night and half asleep.
- mittens to cover their hands for the first few weeks (their fingernails are SHARP and they cut themselves the dummies)
- socks and hats. You do not need shoes ever and they are a pain to get on and off so don't bother
- spit-up cloths. There are fancy ones or we just used cheap cloth diapers
- a mirror that hangs on the back seat so you can see them more easily 
- a warm sleeping bag style car seat cover for winter, you aren't supposed to strap them in wearing a jacket or snowsuit. I liked the jj cole ones https://www.amazon.com/JJ-Cole-Weather-Resistant-Herringbone/dp/B00P1BDGEU
- a bath sponge like this https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Infant-Comfy-Bath-Sponge/dp/B000H953Y2  baby bathtubs are a scam, they are awkward af and your kid ends up afraid of the big tub when you try to transition them. Use the sponge on a counter when they are brand new, then lay them on it in the big tub with an inch of water 
- a plastic bowl or cup to pour water on them in the tub
- a butt thermometer
- baby nail clippers
- a soft bristle hair brush
- bottles, get two sizes iirc 4oz and 8oz are typical
- 2-3 pacifier clips (if you do pacifiers which my kids loved) so you don't have to dig around for it if it falls out of their mouths
- toys that are colorful and different textures & sounds and hang from car seat straps and stuff. 
- a metric fuckton of diapers
- boppy pillow with extra covers for nursing 
- good thick diaper cream
- this is prob controversial but have formula on hand so dad can feed the baby and you can get a break without having to pump!

### Stuff for mom
- CROSSOVER STYLE nursing and sleep bras  https://www.medela.com/breastfeeding/products/maternity-and-nursing-wear/nursing-sleep-bra (you will need to wear bras to sleep because you will leak and need a bra to hold pads) I HATED the snap kinds of bras because it was so awkward to undo while holding the kid
- Henley/crossover style sleeping tops so you can pull your boob out and roll over and nurse without snaps and stuff
- nipple cream. Your nipples will be raw and cracked so you need a good ointment that the baby can safely ingest
- boob pads for soaking up the leakage. You will leak a little bit kind of all the time 
- a pumping bra that will let you pump hands-free. The kind that zips in front is easiest to get on IME https://www.medela.us/breastfeeding/products/nursing-apparel/easy-expression-bustier
- a cute and fun diaper bag that has clips to attach to the handles of a stroller
- get a good baby tracker app that lets you time nursing and keep track of which boob you used (you will be sleep deprived and forget), and let's you set a timer for sleeping & feeding, and tracks poop and pee (the doctor will ask you about this the first few weeks). If it connects to a smart watch that would be great, They didn't really exist when my kids were newborns and I would have loved that feature for nursing!

## Stuff you don't need
- motorized swings and stuff They take up a ton of space, have a very limited timespan, and didn't work well for calming my kids, but ymmv.
- kid-specific bedroom furniture (unless you don't have space in their bedroom for both a changing table and a dresser, getting a dresser with removable changing top makes sense)
- shoes. Shoes for babies are cute but totally useless and dumb and you will spend more time trying to get them on and trying to find them when they fall off than the kid will actually wear them.
- fancy baby clothes. The kid will live in onesies. If someone gives you fancy clothes return them for diapers. The clothes probably won't fit and will be the wrong season because your baby shower will probably be during the wrong season so people will buy shit you can't use. Diapers you can always use!
- expensive shit. Seriously the expensive stuff is almost never worth it, especially the high-end toys and high chairs and strollers.
- heated wipe warmers
- motorized diaper pails

## Pro Tips
- sleep now while you can
- make the crib up with 2-3 layers of mattress cover + sheet so you don't have to remake the crib in the middle of the night from a blowout or leak.
- keep a shirt that you have slept in around for your partner to drape over their shoulder when feeding/calming/putting the baby to sleep. We called it the mama shirt, and it helped a ton for Kento to calm the kids because they could smell mama's pheromones.
- the 90 minute sleep solution method is A LIFESAVER. Seriously if you read one book, please read that one!!!
- periodically take turns sleeping in the baby's room so the other parent can get more than 3-4 hours of sleep.
- babies are not as fragile as they look! You don't need to stress, and you don't need a ton of crap to keep them alive and loved.
