# baby-hacks
Stuff that I learned while having two babies. As with everything, this was my experience and YMMV.

## My overall baby advice can be summed up as follows:

1. Do what feels right for you, don't let societal pressure make you do things that you hate or make you miserable or doesn't feel like it works for you and your kid.
2. Whatever ideas you have before having a baby about the "right" or "wrong" way to parent will fly out the window! You will very quickly learn that you do whatever it takes to survive, and that's okay!
3. Sleep is the most important thing for EVERYONE. The vast majority of my advice will be sleep-related.
4. Seriously, sleep is the most important thing. You will be averaging 4 hours of sleep per day at first and you'll be a wreck if you don't quickly train your kid to sleep better.

## Stuff you need
### Furniture
- crib with option to raise the mattress higher when they are babies, and to convert to a toddler bed when they are older.
- rocking chair/glider with a tall back so you can rest your head and a footstool. The wooden frame ones look ugly but are the best/most comfy!
- changing table(s) if you have two floors you will want one per floor.
- Snoo if you can afford it, they didn't exist for my kids but everyone says they are amazing.
- Pack-n-play with a removable bassinet thingy so you don't have to reach super far down to get the baby out.
- (optional) co-sleeper that attaches to the side of your bed
- extra bed or futon in the baby's room so one parent can get a good nights sleep every now and then
- high chair(s) get a nicer indoor one and then the $20 ikea plastic one that has removable legs for outdoors and travel. You don't need high chairs for the first 4ish months.

## Stuff you don't need
- kid-specific bedroom furniture (unless you don't have space in their bedroom for both a changing table and a dresser, getting a dresser with removable changing top makes sense)
