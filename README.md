# baby-hacks
Stuff that I learned while having two babies. As with everything, this was my experience and YMMV.

### My overall baby advice can be summed up as follows:

1. Do what feels right for you, don't let societal pressure make you do things that you hate or make you miserable or doesn't feel like it works for you and your kid.
2. Whatever ideas you have before having a baby about the "right" or "wrong" way to parent will fly out the window! You will very quickly learn that you do whatever it takes to survive, and that's okay!
3. Sleep is the most important thing for EVERYONE. The vast majority of my advice will be sleep-related.
4. Seriously, sleep is the most important thing. You will be averaging 4 hours of sleep per day at first and you'll be a wreck if you don't quickly train your kid to sleep better.
